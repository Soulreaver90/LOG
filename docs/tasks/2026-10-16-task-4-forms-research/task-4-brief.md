## Global Constraints

- Base ROM: `data\roms\Dragon Ball Z - The Legacy of Goku II (USA).gba`, SHA-1 `18e0715dec419f3501c301511530d2edcd590f8b`. Never write anything under `data\`.
- Builds go to `builds\`. Each build prints its SHA-1 and appends a line to `docs\build-log.md`.
- ROM size: every build is expanded to 16 MB (16777216 bytes) with 0xFF fill. New data goes in the expansion area rom:0x800000-rom:0xFFFFFF. The base 8 MB has no usable free space (Task 1 finding). I approved expansion 2026-10-16 after a 16 MB padded ROM passed the anti-piracy point (East District 439 to the world map).
- The shared OBJ palette at ROM `0x1DA6C8` is not changed. New art uses existing palette indices only.
- The save format is not changed. No new save fields. Old saves must load.
- Rage in the Cell fight is unchanged: its stats, its art set id behavior, and no ki drain. Only playable forms change.
- Super Saiyan 2 values (mine): +20 to STR, POW and END. Ki drain higher than Super Saiyan; start at twice the Super Saiyan drain. Unlock: story flag 195 (Cell beaten).
- Gi look (mine): no white neck piece, brown boots (palette 34, 35), purple toward Piccolo (palette 88, 89, outline 211), red sash, blue wristbands.
- Cutscenes between the Time Chamber and the point where Gohan is playable keep the armor (mine).
- Tests: `py -3 -I -m unittest discover -s scripts\permanent\tests -t scripts\permanent -v` from the root. All must pass before a task is done.
- Python files carry a header block like the existing scripts. No em or en dashes in any file. No byte order mark.
- Install nothing. No git (this folder is not a repo): the build log replaces commits.
- Every reverse-engineering claim is labelled CONFIRMED (with address and disassembly or bytes), LIKELY or SPECULATIVE. Code changes build only on CONFIRMED claims.
- **RE bible:** `docs\RE-BIBLE.md` is the index of every known fact. Read it before a task. Every task that learns a fact adds one line to it, with the tag shapes in its section 1, in the same task. Search it before you search the ROM.

## Review Focus

1. **Old saves after the chamber.** A save made before this patch, with Gohan post-chamber (appearance id 2), loads and shows the gi when playable. Expected: yes. Owned by Task 5 (`test_appearance_2_resolves_to_gi_clone`).
2. **Cutscenes keep the armor.** Every code path that shows armored Gohan without going through the playable appearance still points at the original armor sets. Owned by Task 5 (`test_armor_sets_untouched`).
3. **Super Saiyan 2 before Cell is beaten.** With flag 195 clear, the transform input never reaches Super Saiyan 2, and the Cell fight still forces Rage. Owned by Task 6 (`test_ssj2_gate_reads_flag_195` plus my test 4).
4. **Ki runs out in Super Saiyan 2.** Gohan drops out of the form the same way he does from Super Saiyan. Owned by Task 6 (my test 3).
5. **An animation the source set lacks.** A cloned set never points at a missing or corrupt frame; every record decodes to w*h bytes. Owned by Task 2 (`test_clone_every_record_decodes`).

### Task 4: Reverse engineering, forms, transform input and HUD

**Files:**
- Create: `docs\research\re-forms.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces, as CONFIRMED facts: (a) the form table (per form: stat bonus, ki drain, sprite set or appearance, HUD icon), with the Super Saiyan values (+10 expected) and the Rage values; (b) the transform input handler and how it steps forms (the Z button); (c) how the Cell event forces Rage and keeps ki from draining; (d) where the HUD form icon ("Z") is stored and drawn, and how Buu's Fury draws its "Z3" (reference: `data\sprites\... Buu's Fury - Miscellaneous - HUD.png`); (e) the RAM addresses of Gohan's live STR, POW, END and EP while transformed, for my memory check; (f) the exact patch sites for Task 6 with original bytes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Find the form table** from the Super Saiyan +10 (status screen values 100 to 110 in my screenshot). Start from the appearance table at `rom:0x1D967C`: +0 bit 0 marks a transformed form and +4 names the form to transform into, so the stat bonus and ki drain are likely keyed by appearance entry.
- [ ] **Step 2: Trace the transform input** from the Z button press to the form change.
- [ ] **Step 3: Trace Rage** in the Cell event: which form id, and what stops the drain.
- [ ] **Step 4: Find the HUD icon** graphics (codec or raw) and its draw call.
- [ ] **Step 5: I verify** each CONFIRMED line before Task 6 starts. If the form system is hard-coded per event so that a new form needs large code changes, stop and report to me.
